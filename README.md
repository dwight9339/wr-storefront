### Description
Storefront for store.winterriddle.com. Built with NextJS, it implements a simple interface for users to browse and learn about products, add products to a cart, and checkout. The storefront uses a Medusa backend (located [here](https://github.com/dwight9339/wr-backend)) which implements a custom fulfillment provider for processing order fulfillment with Shippo, a custom payment provider which uses the Stripe hosted checkout api to provide a simple, secure payment experience, and a custom api endpoint for fetching the record of an anonymous customer to allow customers to checkout without creating an account.

## Set Up Project
### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14 or greater installed on your machine
- A Stripe account
- A Shippo account

### Install Project
1. Clone the custom backend server project found [here](https://github.com/dwight9339/wr-backend)
2. Create a postgres database and a .env file as described [here](https://docs.medusajs.com/usage/configurations). Also include a variable called STRIPE_API_KEY which will contain your Stripe secret key as well as one called SHIPPO_API_KEY which will, of course, hold your Shippo API key.
3. Install the file storage solution plugin of your choice. I went with [S3](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/s3).
4. Clone the Medusa admin app found [here](https://github.com/dwight9339/medusa_admin) and use it to set up your store. It's the same as the official Medusa admin app except in how it creates shipping options. Make sure to create a region and add the Shippo and Stripe providers. Create a shipping option named Shippo that uses the Shippo fulfillment method.
5. Clone the storefront app found from this repository. Create a .env.local file in the root folder with the following variables:
`
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_HOST=<URL of backend server>
SHIPPO_API_KEY=<Shippo API key>
SHIPPO_FROM_ADDRESS=<ID of address created in Shippo API that you would like to use as a from address for shipping>
IMAGE_DOMAIN=<Image domain where product photos are hosted>
`
